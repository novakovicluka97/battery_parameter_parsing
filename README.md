# Battery Cell Testing

Battery Cell Testing project contains required scripts, model descriptions and hardware desings that enables Typhoon HIL devices to be used as battery cell cyclers.
The project consists of:
- Automated testing scripts that perform the battery cycling and are measuring the cell therminal votlages
- Data conversion scripts that compute all the Battery Cell model parameters out of the terminal voltage values
- Battery Cell model object description
- 18650 battery holder PCB
